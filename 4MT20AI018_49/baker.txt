It was a small village. And in it, was a small bakery. 
The baker would buy 1 Kg of butter for his bakery from a certain milkman periodically.

One day, the baker grew suspicious about the weight of the butter.
He weighed it and found it to be just 900 g. He was furious but thought of giving the milkman a couple more chances.
And he was proved right the next two times too. His anger got the better of him and he handed over the milkman to the police.
The milkman was produced to the court the next day.
Judge: Don't you have a weighing balance at your house?
Milkman: I do. But I don't have weights for it.
Judge: Then how were you weighing the butter all these days?
.
Milkman: Your honor, I own only a couple of buffaloes.
	 And their yield is also not substantial. 
	 That's why I don't have weights for the scale. I buy bread from this baker itself. 	 
	 He claims that one packet of his bread weighs 500 g. 
	 So I keep 2 packets of bread in the weighing scale and weigh my butter.
